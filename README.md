## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js and npm installed on your machine.

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd my-app
   ```
3. Install the dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

### Running the Application
To start the application, you can use a local server or open the `index.html` file directly in your browser. If you have a live server extension in your code editor, you can use that for a better development experience.

### Usage
- Open `src/index.html` in your browser to view the application.
- Modify `src/main.js` to change the application logic.
- Update `src/styles/main.scss` to customize the styles.
